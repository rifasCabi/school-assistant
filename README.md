# school-assistant
A school app assistant to help with organizing files and manage college stuff

##Ideas and Features
[ ] Manager for subject folders
  [ ] Capable of handling a defined structure
  [ ] Should be able to create and interact with folders and files
  [ ] Able to divide the classes and themes of each subject and get links to outside the main folders (specialy to the workspace for subject projects)
[ ] An easy to navigate interface (might need to present same information in diferent locations but not duplicate content on the folders themselves)
[ ] Folders and folder structure should be independent from the interface and readable alone
